RPG is a game allowing you to live in a NetHack type world.

RPG is Copyright (c) 2023 by John Worthington (woodmage@gmail.com)

It is licensed under the GPL version 3, so feel free to steal from it, though I would appreciate it if you acknowledge me.

RPG has been created by a collaboration between myself (John Worthington) and Claude 2 (claude.ai/chat).  Claude 2 is an AI system built and owned by Anthropic (anthropic.com).

I would like to point out that Claude has been instrumental in many aspects of this program and has helped me gain a better understanding of C# and Object Oriented Programming while helping me with many aspects of this game and its logic.

Claude makes a great collaborator for coding!  I highly recommend him (I know, it, but to me, it is a him).

This is still a work in progress and is not yet ready for use, but feel free to look at it and play with it.
